Tiny bash script to add [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) to existing solidity projects. Compatible with hardhat. Adapted from [foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/hardhat#use-foundry-in-an-existing-hardhat-project).

## Usage

Make sure you have bash and curl installed on your system. Navigate to the existing project and run:

```bash
bash <( curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxhvl/foundryize/main/foundryize.sh)

The script will guide you through the process and provide instructions for the next steps.
